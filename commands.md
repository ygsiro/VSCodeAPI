# commands

Namespace for dealing with commands.
In short, a command is a function with a unique identifier.
The function is sometimes also called *command handler*.

Commands can be added to the editor using the [registerCommand](#registercommand) and
[registerTextEditorCommand](#registertexteditorcommand) functions.
Commands can be executed manually or from a UI gesture.
Those are:

+ palette -  Use the `commands`-section in `package.json` to make a command show in the command palette.
+ keybinding - Use the `keybindings`-section in `package.json` to enable keybindings for your extension.

Commands from other extensions and from the editor itself are accessible to an extension.
However, when invoking an editor command not all argument types are supported.

This is a sample that registers a command handler and adds an entry for that command to the palette.
First register a command handler with the identifier `extension.sayHello`.

```typescript
commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {
  window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
});
```

Second, bind the command identifier to a title under which it will show in the palette(`package.json`).

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "extension.sayHello",
        "title": "Hello World"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
